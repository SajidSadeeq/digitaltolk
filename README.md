My thoughts

1. We should employ request validation in adherence to the SOLID principle, specifically the Single Responsibility Principle.
2. If these are apis, we should write api docs as well e.g. (open api docs)
3. We should use try catch for better error handling
3. Response is not synchronized, it should always return an array having status, messsage, data etc for all functions or we have global response function
4. Static text should be returned from localization
5. Variable names should be descriptive
6. Always remove unnecessary code
7. Use strict_types
8. Use request()->only() instead of all(), because all() is not secure
9. use phpstan for better code scaling (start low to high mode)


#What makes it good,
repository design pattern, this will make controller cleaner

#what makes it terrible
1. you are using respository design patteren for test cases as well, for test cases we can use factories which will make our code clearner and presize as well. (although respository design pattern is good for test cases as well but laravel offers factories)
2. laravel helper functions not properly used which will make code cleaner
